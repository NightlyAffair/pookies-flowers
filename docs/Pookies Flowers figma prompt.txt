Your task: Come up with possible designs for the above business, that I can paste into Figma Make, an AI that will create a sample website. 

Colors: find from /public/images/logo

Vibe: It should be whimisical and fun rather than serious.

We will be implementing 3d and scrolling animations as well, but that doesn't matter at this protoyping stage.



Design a whimsical, playful landing page for "Pookie's Flowers," a home-based florist. Color palette: deep navy (#0F2044) as the primary dark background, rose pink (#E88AB5)   as the accent color, and cream white (#F5EDE0) for text and highlights. Use soft, rounded, hand-drawn-feeling typography and organic, flowing shapes throughout.    Hero Section: Full-width section with a large, dreamy hero image of a lush flower arrangement. Overlay a playful headline like "Flowers that make you smile" in a whimsical   serif or handwritten font. Include two side-by-side CTA buttons in rose pink: "Subscribe to Vase Arrangements" and "Order a Custom Bouquet." Subtle petal or leaf   illustrations scattered around the edges.    Products Preview Section: Two large side-by-side cards on a cream background. Left card shows a vase arrangement photo with the title "Vase Arrangement Subscription" and a   short tagline like "Fresh blooms delivered to your door, every week." Right card shows a custom bouquet photo with the title "Custom Bouquets" and tagline "Handcrafted for   your special moments." Each card has a rounded CTA button. Use soft blob shapes or wavy dividers between sections.    About/Story Strip: A narrow horizontal band in navy with cream text — a single playful sentence like "Made with love from our home to yours" with a small illustrated rose   accent.    Footer: Simple navy footer with cream text, social media icons, and a small version of the logo. Keep the overall feeling warm, inviting, and fun — not corporate or stiff.    ---   2. Vase Arrangements Subpage    Design a subpage for "Pookie's Flowers" focused on their vase arrangement subscription service. Same color palette: deep navy (#0F2044), rose pink (#E88AB5), cream white   (#F5EDE0). Whimsical, fun, and warm — not serious or minimal.    Page Hero: A wide banner with a lifestyle photo of a vase arrangement on a kitchen table or living room shelf. Headline in a playful font: "Vase Arrangements" with a   subheading like "A fresh burst of joy, delivered on repeat." Cream text on a navy overlay. Wavy or organic-shaped edges on the banner instead of a hard bottom line.    How It Works Section: Three-step horizontal row on a cream background. Each step is an illustrated circle icon with a short label: "1. Pick your plan," "2. We arrange fresh   blooms," "3. Enjoy your flowers!" Use rose pink for the step numbers and navy for the text. Connect the steps with a playful dotted or curved line.    Arrangement Gallery: A grid (2x3 or 3x2) of past vase arrangements with rounded-corner photo cards. Each card has a short whimsical name (e.g., "Sunday Sunshine," "Berry   Blush," "Garden Party") and a small description below. Cards float on a soft navy background with subtle petal illustrations in the margins.    Subscription CTA Section: A large, attention-grabbing section in rose pink background with navy text. Headline: "Ready to brighten your space?" with a big rounded   cream-colored "Subscribe Now" button. Small text underneath: "Cancel anytime. Happiness guaranteed."    Footer: Same consistent footer as homepage.    ---   3. Custom Bouquets Subpage    Design a subpage for "Pookie's Flowers" focused on custom bouquet ordering. Same color palette: deep navy (#0F2044), rose pink (#E88AB5), cream white (#F5EDE0). Keep the vibe    whimsical, playful, and heartfelt.    Page Hero: A close-up, rich photo of a hand-tied bouquet being held or wrapped in paper. Headline: "Custom Bouquets" with subheading: "Tell us the vibe. We'll make it bloom."    Cream text over a dark navy overlay. Organic, wavy bottom edge on the hero image.    Occasions Section: On a cream background, a row of 4 playful illustrated cards for occasions: "Birthdays," "Anniversaries," "Just Because," "Sympathy." Each card has a small   hand-drawn style icon (cake, heart, smiley, candle) in rose pink with navy labels. Rounded corners and a subtle shadow to make them pop.    Past Work Gallery: A masonry-style or staggered photo grid showing 5-6 past custom bouquets in different styles and color palettes. Photos have soft rounded corners. Section   title: "Some bouquets we've loved making." Cream background with small scattered petal illustrations.    Order Form CTA Section: Navy background section with a simple, inviting form or a prompt to get started. Headline: "Let's create something beautiful together." Fields for   name, occasion, color preferences, and a message box — or alternatively a single large "Start Your Order" rose pink button that links to a form. Keep it simple and   approachable, not intimidating.    Testimonial Strip: A single-row horizontal scroll or a centered quote block. One or two short customer quotes like: "She made my mom cry happy tears!" in italic cream text on    navy, with a small rose pink quotation mark accent.    Footer: Same consistent footer as the other pages.
